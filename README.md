# CORS
Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Summary : Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. However, it also provides potential for cross-domain based attacks, if a website's CORS policy is poorly configured and implemented. CORS can be exploited to trust any arbitrary domain attacker controlled domain name and send the data to it.  Attackers can make an exploit and ask the domain to send data of the victim to the attacker domain.
